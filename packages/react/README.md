# @solar-icons/react

The `@solar-icons/react` package provides a robust, flexible, and easy-to-use library of React components for the Solar icon set. This package enables developers to seamlessly integrate Solar's multi-style icons into React applications, supporting both client-side rendering (CSR) and server-side rendering (SSR).

## Installation

Install the package using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @solar-icons/react
```

or

```bash
yarn add @solar-icons/react
```

## Usage

To use an icon in your React application, simply import it from the package:

```jsx
import solar, { ArrowUp } from '@solar-icons/react'
import { Arrows } from '@solar-icons/react/category'

function App() {
    return (
        <>
            <ArrowUp size={24} weight="Outline" mirrored />
            <solar.Arrows.ArrowDown size={32} weight="BoldDuotone" />
            <Arrows.AltArrowLeft color="#fff" className="bg-black" weight="Bold" />
        </>
    )
}
```

### Properties

Each icon component supports the following properties:

- **`size`**: Defines the size of the icon (e.g., `24`, `"1.5em"`).
- **`color`**: Sets the color of the icon (e.g., `"#000"`, `"currentColor"`).
- **`weight`**: Specifies the icon style. Options include `"Bold"`, `"Linear"`, `"Outline"`, `"BoldDuotone"`, `"LineDuotone"`, and `"Broken"`.
- **`mirrored`**: Flips the icon horizontally when set to `true`.

## Advanced Usage

### Global Icon Configuration

To apply consistent styles across multiple icons, use the `SolarProvider` component to wrap your application:

```jsx
import { SolarProvider } from '@solar-icons/react'

function App() {
    return (
        <SolarProvider value={{ size: '32', color: 'purple', weight: 'Linear' }}>
            <YourComponents />
        </SolarProvider>
    )
}
```

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

The `@solar-icons/react` package is optimized for SSR, ensuring that icons render correctly on both the client and server sides:

```jsx
import solar, { ArrowUp } from '@solar-icons/react/ssr'
import { Arrows } from '@solar-icons/react/ssr/category'

function App() {
    return (
        <>
            <ArrowUp size={24} weight="Outline" />
            <solar.Arrows.ArrowDown size={32} weight="BoldDuotone" />
            <Arrows.AltArrowLeft color="#fff" className="bg-black" weight="Bold" />
        </>
    )
}
```
