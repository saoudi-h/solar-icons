description: The performance-optimized package for Solar Icons in React, designed for minimal bundle size.
icon: react
---

The `@solar-icons/react-perf` package is tailored for developers who prioritize performance and reduced bundle sizes. Each icon component includes only a single style, making it significantly lighter than the standard `@solar-icons/react` package.

```package-install
@solar-icons/react-perf
```

## Key Features

- **Performance-Oriented**: Each icon is a separate, lightweight component.
- **Minimal Bundle Size**: Only the specific icon styles you import are added to your application.
- **Explicit Imports**: Encourages deliberate choices about icon styles.
- **TypeScript Ready**: Comes with full TypeScript support.

## When to Use It

You should use this package if your application's bundle size is a primary concern and you do not need to change icon styles dynamically at runtime. It's ideal for large-scale applications where performance is critical.

For more guidance, see the [**Choosing a Package**](/docs/getting-started/choosing-a-package) guide.

## Usage

Import icons by their combined name and style (e.g., `IconName` + `Style` = `IconNameStyle`).

```jsx
import { HomeBold, SettingsLinear } from '@solar-icons/react-perf'

function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <HomeBold color="green" size={24} />
            <SettingsLinear color="orange" size={24} />
        </div>
    )
}
```

### Importing by Style Path

For cleaner code, you can import from style-specific entry points. This allows you to use the base icon name.

```jsx
import { Home } from '@solar-icons/react-perf/bold'
import { Settings } from '@solar-icons/react-perf/linear'

function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <Home size={24} />
            <Settings size={24} />
        </div>
    )
}
```

## Component Props

Each icon component accepts the following props, in addition to all standard SVG attributes like `className` and `onClick`.

| Prop       | Type               | Default        | Description                                |
| ---------- | ------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `color`    | `string`           | `currentColor` | Sets the icon's color.                     |
| `size`     | `string \| number` | `1em`          | Sets the icon's width and height.          |
| `mirrored` | `boolean`          | `false`        | Flips the icon horizontally if `true`.     |
| `alt`      | `string`           | `undefined`    | Provides an accessible title for the icon. |
