To start using Solar Icons, install the package corresponding to your framework.

## React

Our React icons are available through two packages, depending on your performance and flexibility needs.

### Standard Package

The `@solar-icons/react` package is designed for maximum versatility and ease of use. Each icon component includes all six styles, allowing you to change styles dynamically.

```package-install
@solar-icons/react
```

### Performance Package

For optimized performance, the `@solar-icons/react-perf` package provides icon components that integrate only a single style. This significantly reduces the bundle size.

```package-install
@solar-icons/react-perf
```
