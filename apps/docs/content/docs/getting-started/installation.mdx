To start using Solar Icons, install the package corresponding to your framework.

## React

Our React icons are available through two packages, depending on your performance and flexibility needs.

### Standard Package

The `@solar-icons/react` package is designed for maximum versatility and ease of use. Each icon component includes all six styles, allowing you to change styles dynamically.

```package-install
@solar-icons/react
```

### Performance Package

For optimized performance, the `@solar-icons/react-perf` package provides icon components that integrate only a single style. This significantly reduces the bundle size.

```package-install
@solar-icons/react-perf
```

## Vue

The `@solar-icons/vue` package brings the same rich feature set as the React package to Vue applications, including multi-style icons, global providers, and category imports.

```package-install
@solar-icons/vue
```

## Nuxt

For Nuxt 3+, use the dedicated `@solar-icons/nuxt` module. It offers seamless integration with auto-import, `nuxi` installation, and global configuration.

```shell
nuxi module add @solar-icons/nuxt
```
