import { Cards, Card } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/card'

Solar Icons packages are sometimes available in **two variants**:

- **Standard package** — maximizes flexibility and ease of use.
- **Performance package** (suffix `-perf`) — optimized for minimal bundle size.

The best choice depends on your priorities: flexibility vs performance.

## General Comparison

| Feature                  | Standard Package            | Performance Package (`-perf`) |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Dynamic Styles**       | ✅ Yes                      | ❌ No                          |
| **Bundle Size**          | Larger                      | ✅ Smaller                     |
| **Global Configuration** | ✅ Yes (if supported)        | ❌ No                          |
| **Ease of Use**          | ✅ High                     | Good                           |
| **Primary Use Case**     | Versatility & Development   | Performance-critical apps      |

## How it works

**Standard packages** include **all six icon styles** within each component.  
This makes them ideal for:

- Prototyping or applications where styles may change dynamically.
- Projects that value ease of use over bundle size.
- Global styling via a provider (when available).

**Performance packages** include **only a single icon style** per component.  
This is perfect for:

- Applications where bundle size is critical.
- Situations where you know the exact style you need in advance.
- Environments without global configuration needs.

## Example: React

For React, the two packages are:

<Card
    title="@solar-icons/react"
    description="The versatile choice — all styles available in each icon, with global configuration support."
/>

<Card
    title="@solar-icons/react-perf"
    description="The performance choice — each icon includes only one style, drastically reducing bundle size."
/>
